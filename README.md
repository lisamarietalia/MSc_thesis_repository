# MSc_thesis_repository
In this repository are stored the pyhton codes created and used for my MSc thesis: Optimal placement of green, blue and yellow roofs under uncertainty. 

## What are these files for?
Climate data in netcdf format, taken from EUROCORDEX platform can be processes thanks to this script. The output would be a selection of days of mid-heavy rainfall, summer days and sun-peak hours. 

The pulp version of the model can be deployed to solve a linearized version of the model, without having access to Gurobi.

The uncertainty analysis file allows to discover which parameters are mostly influential to the solution.

We also report the stochastic and robust example of formualtion, and the multi-time step model.
